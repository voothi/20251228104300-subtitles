So what's new with you?
@@@
What's new with me?
@@@
I was in Poland.
@@@
Seriously?
@@@
Recently, yeah.
@@@
Who did you meet with?
@@@
With you.
@@@
No way?
@@@
Yeah.
@@@
So what were we doing there?
@@@
Oh, we were preparing a New Year's surprise for our subscribers.
@@@
Oh yeah, at the end today we'll talk a little more about it, right?
@@@
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
@@@
Yeah.
@@@
I see.
@@@
So I was in Warsaw too, it turns out.
@@@
Met you.
@@@
I was also in Krakow and saw Krakow for the first time in my life.
@@@
Was it your first time in Krakow?
@@@
Yeah, yeah.
@@@
And how did you like it?
@@@
Beautiful.
@@@
Listen, well, all that's left for you is to get to Wroclaw.
@@@
Yeah, and you can say you've seen all of Poland.
@@@
Pretty much all of Poland.
@@@
Could I have just gone to Wroclaw?
@@@
Well, yeah.
@@@
What are you talking about?
@@@
Well, look, I've been to Warsaw, I've been to Gdansk.
@@@
And Krakow now.
@@@
So only Wroclaw is left, it turns out.
@@@
Wait.
@@@
Lublin.
@@@
Poznan.
@@@
Bialystok.
@@@
Lodz.
@@@
Bialystok.
@@@
Katowice.
@@@
That's just what I...
@@@
Biala Podlaska, but that's...
@@@
Biala Podlaska.
@@@
Bielsko-Biala.
@@@
Zakopane.
@@@
Zielona Gora.
@@@
Jelenia Gora.
@@@
Bydgoszcz.
@@@
A ton of cities that are worth visiting.
@@@
What's most interesting is that in Poland they are more or less similar, but still, each one has something of its own.
@@@
Every single one stands out in some way.
@@@
You still need to travel around Poland more.
@@@
I'm telling you.
@@@
Anyway, yeah, yeah.
@@@
Get me a Globe of Poland, please, so I know where to go.
@@@
Better yet, someday I'll gift you a vacation in Poland.
@@@
There.
@@@
We'll get in a car and drive all over Poland.
@@@
That would be awesome.
@@@
That would be awesome.
@@@
We could record an episode from the car at the same time.
@@@
Yeah, by the way, yeah.
@@@
If you want to become sponsors for our episode from the car, we've already been in contact.
@@@
Write to us.
@@@
Hello everyone, our dear podcast listeners.
@@@
This is a new episode of the Na Vibe podcast.
@@@
A podcast about news, artificial intelligence, and all sorts of other topics related to artificial intelligence for programmers and beyond.
@@@
And with you are your regular hosts - myself, Viktor Shlenchenko, and...
@@@
I'm Alexey Kartynnik.
@@@
Yeeeah, super.
@@@
Okay, what was that?
@@@
For the second time in the history of our podcast.
@@@
You swiped, I'm not afraid to use the word, my intro.
@@@
Well, you were silent, so I took the intro into my own hands.
@@@
Well, alright, thank you actually, because today my mood is kinda meh.
@@@
For all Belarusians, I would say.
@@@
Those who know, know.
@@@
That's for sure, that's for sure.
@@@
So,
@@@
we've done the intro.
@@@
Done.
@@@
Yeah, done.
@@@
We're not playing music today.
@@@
But we are playing something else.
@@@
We're putting up a reminder for our dear listeners that the Na Vibe podcast, formerly the AIA podcast, is now released exclusively thanks to our premium listeners.
@@@
Premium listeners are people who give us a recurring donation.
@@@
We have several different subscription plans: Go, Pro, and Ultra, where, besides supporting us, which is kind of the main point of these donations, you also get a lot of different cool bonuses.
@@@
For example, you get added to the premium chat, you get access to recordings of all our streams uncensored and without any cuts whatsoever.
@@@
And we post them earlier, literally right away.
@@@
Like, we record today, and we post it tonight.
@@@
No need to wait.
@@@
They appear there earlier, so there's no need to wait.
@@@
You also get access to a unique post-cast, the Post-Vibe Post-cast.
@@@
It's a completely separate podcast that exists exclusively for our premium listeners, where Lesha and I talk about all sorts of interesting things related to AI, science fiction, and other stuff.
@@@
For example, we have an episode where Lesha talks about a science fiction book by a Belarusian author called "Pentakvandr".
@@@
Actually, it's a pretty unique episode, because the book isn't very popular yet.
@@@
And maybe you'll be able to read it, or maybe you'll be able to listen to it.
@@@
Well, there's some inside info that it's slowly being translated into English from Belarusian, but you can still treat yourself.
@@@
Nevertheless, yes, you can treat yourself.
@@@
We have a True Crime podcast, which, damn, I wrote myself with Chat GPT.
@@@
A debut?
@@@
The debut one, yes, about AI murders, so to speak.
@@@
And a third one, the very newest, the latest one, hot off the press, where I retell Andy Weir's book Project Hail Mary.
@@@
And what's more, you can manage to listen to it before the film adaptation comes out.
@@@
It's coming out in 2026.
@@@
If you happen to be afraid of spoilers, don't be.
@@@
It's heavy-duty science fiction that's impossible to retell in any detail in an hour and a half.
@@@
So there are plot spoilers, but they're the big-picture ones.
@@@
And overall, personally, I haven't read the book, and I'm planning to watch the movie.
@@@
And after that summary, I have even more of a pre-New Year's desire to read the book, because the plot is interesting and I want to get into the details.
@@@
Yeah, that's true.
@@@
And I retold the details very shittily.
@@@
Intentionally.
@@@
Yes, purely intentionally.
@@@
Not because I'm dumb and don't understand half of the physics references written there.
@@@
But just intentionally.
@@@
That's right.
@@@
Yes, all these episodes are already available.
@@@
So subscribe, subscribe, you'll have a great time.
@@@
Especially at this time, before the New Year, when there's a lot of time to listen to something good.
@@@
And there will only be more episodes, actually.
@@@
And for other bonuses, that's not all the bonuses available to our premium members.
@@@
All premium members get access to a premium chat, where we answer first, we hang out there, we chat.
@@@
Also, all premium members get access to the SMS chat.
@@@
It's a little chat where you can send your messages of up to 120 characters before each episode.
@@@
Like in text messages.
@@@
And we will read these messages live on air.
@@@
By the way, we have one text message today.
@@@
We'll read it shortly.
@@@
And if you subscribe to the maximum Ultra tier, along with it you'll get a yearly subscription to the Code Evolution club, where you can seriously level up in programming with AI.
@@@
And you'll get a yearly subscription to the DeeDee app, where you can keep your ADHD in check.
@@@
Very well.
@@@
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
@@@
A full year's access.
@@@
That's all correct.
@@@
So there are a lot of bonuses, the bonuses are cool, but first and foremost, you'll be supporting our podcast this way.
@@@
Right now it's really released exclusively thanks to you, thanks to our audience, thanks to your support for this podcast.
@@@
Yeah, and guys, I get that, like, maybe some of you are tired of hearing us, guys and girls, talk about this, and today with pretty sour faces on top of it, but this is truly fucking important.
@@@
I mean, well, we get donations, but it's honestly not nearly enough yet.
@@@
And if you've been thinking about whether to donate or not, please, think again, find the opportunity if you have one.
@@@
Thank you.
@@@
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
@@@
We need at least, I think, 200-300 donors so we can more or less breathe a sigh of relief.
@@@
Right now we have what, 37 people?
@@@
Around 36.
@@@
Just keeping you in the loop, yeah.
@@@
So the number isn't tiny, but it's not large either.
@@@
We're counting on your support.
@@@
We seem to be doing good things.
@@@
And if you want to hear the quality of the extra content we release, these three extra episodes, we show them to you, we usually tease them in the episodes.
@@@
Today at the end of our podcast there will be 6 minutes from the episode where Vitya talks about the Project Hail Mary.
@@@
You can listen to it too, and judge for yourself.
@@@
Maybe it will be easier for you to make a decision after that.
@@@
And, I guess, it's worth saying that we're also looking for partners.
@@@
If someone listening to us suddenly wants to help the podcast by becoming a permanent sponsor of the podcast,
@@@
contact us directly.
@@@
All contact information is in the podcast description.
@@@
It could be a one-time donation from a person or a company.
@@@
It could be full sponsorship support, where we'll talk about your services, your things, and make a separate segment for you.
@@@
You'll be supporting us that way.
@@@
We will gladly accept all of that.
@@@
So, reach out.
@@@
In short, we do ads too.
@@@
Just like everyone else.
@@@
Well, on that note, I think we can begin.
@@@
Yes, let's move on to our regular segment "Big Fish".
@@@
By the way, this is the last "Big Fish" of the year.
@@@
Just so you know.
@@@
Because the next episode will be unusual.
@@@
There will be no big fish there.
@@@
That's a small spoiler for it.
@@@
So that's why "Big Fish".
@@@
And they start with, what would you think.
@@@
No suspense, with OpenAI.
@@@
This is going to be the saddest episode of all time for us.
@@@
Yeah, it's fucked.
@@@
Vitya says, the last "Big Fish" and I'm like...
@@@
Fuck...
@@@
Yeah, I said it, and then I realized.
@@@
Alright, let's start with OpenAI.
@@@
OpenAI.
@@@
Anyway, anyway.
@@@
As we know, there's a national sport in the US.
@@@
And not just in the US.
@@@
It's investing in OpenAI.
@@@
And now Amazon will be investing in OpenAI.
@@@
Just so you know, the deal is for 500 billion bucks.
@@@
What 500 billion?
@@@
10.
@@@
500 is the valuation OpenAI will secure after this deal.
@@@
Damn, yeah, sorry.
@@@
Amazon doesn't have that much money.
@@@
They're worth 4 billion there.
@@@
4 trillion or however much.
@@@
Yes, I'm sorry, please excuse me.
@@@
Yeah, Bezos wouldn't have forked over that much.
@@@
Anyway, 10 billion bucks.
@@@
The total valuation of OpenAI becomes 500 billion.
@@@
And, as a matter of fact, the supply of Titanium chips to OpenAI.
@@@
Trainium.
@@@
Well, basically, they will provide that 10 billion just with these Trainium chips.
@@@
In fact.
@@@
With hardware.
@@@
Well, and AWS capacity, yes.
@@@
The funny thing is that this way they're also stepping on Nvidia's toes.
@@@
With their Trainium chips.
@@@
These are tensor chips, I think, that are really messing things up for them, along with the angle.
@@@
Are they called Trainium?
@@@
And people always read it as Titanium?
@@@
Trainium, Trainium.
@@@
Ah, oh, right, Trainium.
@@@
Damn, that's crazy.
@@@
Vitya Vedmich and I were talking recently, he said Trainium, and I was also like, damn, I thought they were Titanium.
@@@
Well, no, Trainium.
@@@
Trainium 3.
@@@
I think we always said Titanium, didn't we?
@@@
Well, I think I thought so too.
@@@
I don't remember, do we have news about Amazon later on or not, I think?
@@@
It's just that...
@@@
I don't think so.
@@@
There won't be.
@@@
Then I'll add a bit more here about these Trainium chips.
@@@
They announced the third version, which they will most likely,
@@@
in particular, be pushing on OpenAI.
@@@
But they also announced Trainium 4.
@@@
I appreciate the level of trolling, or I don't know what it is.
@@@
It's probably not trolling, but, in short, they said that they will have Trainium 4 chips that will be compatible with Nvidia GPUs via an Nvidia bus,
@@@
NVFusion, NVLink Fusion.
@@@
I don't know, well, like, on the one hand,
@@@
they probably collaborated with Nvidia there, because you'd probably need to get some data or something from NVD.
@@@
Or maybe it's an open protocol?
@@@
Well, in short, it's strange.
@@@
Like, we're making a competitor and we'll also be compatible with you, the competitor, to... you even more.
@@@
Well yeah, from Amazon's point of view, it's as logical as it gets.
@@@
Well, in general, OpenAI is, of course, just some kind of monstrous company.
@@@
There was some news about that too, wasn't there.
@@@
We didn't add it, but it popped up today, very fittingly.
@@@
OpenAI will be buying up about 40% of all memory chips produced in the world until 2029.
@@@
That's official now.
@@@
As part of the Stargate project.
@@@
Because of that, everyone is already...
@@@
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
@@@
Partly because of this, gamers are already saying that it will get even more expensive.
@@@
Can you imagine, some startup from 3 years ago, which was a startup 4 years ago, is buying up 40% of the world's entire RAM.
@@@
And 4 years ago, it was also a non-profit organization.
@@@
Just for a second.
@@@
Damn, just such a scale.
@@@
Yeah.
@@@
So that's the thing.
@@@
But besides the news about purchases, about money, they had a lot of tech-related news in recent weeks.
@@@
First, the top model GPT-5.2 was released.
@@@
It's OpenAI's flagship.
@@@
Three versions of this model were released in parallel, no, not in parallel, but one after another, you could even say four.
@@@
First came GPT-5.2, then literally a few days later came GPT-5.2 Pro.
@@@
This is, de facto, the most powerful model in existence today.
@@@
And then, along with Pro, GPT-5.2 Thinking was released.
@@@
It's supposedly tailored for math and science.
@@@
And then, like a week later, maybe, or a little later, the GPT-5.2 Codex model for programming was released.
@@@
How not to get confused?
@@@
GPT-5.2 is the direct successor to GPT-5.1.
@@@
Most likely, 5.1 will be deprecated soon.
@@@
It costs almost the same.
@@@
The price literally went up by...
@@@
How much is that?
@@@
Somewhere around 10 or 15 percent.
@@@
It used to cost 1.5 dollars per million input tokens.
@@@
Now it's 1.75.
@@@
And it works better, it's better on benchmarks.
@@@
A little bit slower, but it seems like that has already leveled out.
@@@
And what's important, GPT-5.2 is finally a model with fresh data.
@@@
It was trained on data up to August 2025.
@@@
All previous models were trained on data up to September 2024.
@@@
They were really hated on for that.
@@@
We're not particularly interested in GPT-5.2 Pro and Thinking because, first of all,
@@@
they are not available to everyone.
@@@
They are available there...
@@@
Pro is available via API, Thinking is available God knows how, but both models cost a fortune.
@@@
The Pro version costs 21 bucks per million input and 168 per million output tokens.
@@@
These are similarly expensive models.
@@@
They probably were, remember, when, I think, GPT-5 or 4.5 first came out.
@@@
5 Pro had a crazy price tag back then too.
@@@
When the first Pro came out.
@@@
Anyway, it's...
@@@
The 5 series, I think it was.
@@@
Research models.
@@@
And with Codex, things aren't so great either.
@@@
It seems that, well, Codex is relevant to us, to our audience, we have a lot of developers.
@@@
But 5.2 Codex will only be available in the API in early 2026.
@@@
And for now, it's only available through their command-line interface Codex.
@@@
Well, or through an extension for that command-line interface.
@@@
So that's the news on development models from OpenAI.
@@@
Yeah, but it's not just about development alone.
@@@
But, first of all, these aren't just models for development.
@@@
Well, yeah, yeah, yeah.
@@@
I mean, with LLMs.
@@@
You can barely even call them LLMs anymore.
@@@
With models that primarily work with text.
@@@
Let's put it this way, foundational models.
@@@
There.
@@@
But GPT, or rather, OpenAI, remembered that they have a model that generates images.
@@@
GPT Image.
@@@
And they remembered that they apparently hadn't pushed an update there in a long, long time.
@@@
And so they finally deployed it.
@@@
GPT Image 1.5 came out.
@@@
It's a competitor to Nado Banano Pro.
@@@
They claimed that it works super fast, almost faster than, like, Nado Banano and others.
@@@
But in fact, it works slower.
@@@
And on the benchmarks I have, it's the same.
@@@
The quality...
@@@
Damn, the quality is great, in my opinion.
@@@
Does it generate text normally now?
@@@
It has for a while, it was fine even in the first version.
@@@
No, it was fine in the first version, but sometimes it would make a mistake in Russian, like, it would get a letter wrong every three words.
@@@
Nado Banano doesn't do that at all.
@@@
It writes everything correctly.
@@@
It can, like, write a whole A4 page of text, yeah, if you ask it to write.
@@@
Listen, I haven't tested it that deeply, but it generates really well.
@@@
I also saw they have a new tab, Images, well, that's a minor thing.
@@@
It used to be called Gallery, now it's Images.
@@@
Yeah, like little pictures.
@@@
I also saw an inside scoop today about all these models.
@@@
It's unknown if it's an inside scoop or maybe fiction, but they say that GPT 5.2 and Images 1.5 are checkpoints for their next models.
@@@
Very early checkpoints.
@@@
So, it's possible that before the New Year, or in early February, OpenAI will delight us with new models again.
@@@
Like, way better than these ones.
@@@
Well, they have to pull away from Google somehow.
@@@
Well, yeah.
@@@
With all their might.
@@@
They're saying the same thing about Google, that Gemini 3 Pro is also an early checkpoint.
@@@
Alright.
@@@
A little tab for GPT Images appeared.
@@@
what else appeared in GPT?
@@@
Pinned chats?
@@@
Pinned chats?
@@@
Well, thank you.
@@@
That'll be useful.
@@@
But the thing that appeared next,
@@@
I don't know if you've had a chance to try it or not.
@@@
I haven't had a chance to try it, I'll be honest with you.
@@@
But the news is interesting.
@@@
Well, tell me.
@@@
Well, you tell me, and then I'll say what I've managed to do.
@@@
In short, they added Photoshop to ChatGPT.
@@@
I'll remind you that they recently added Nano Banana Pro to Photoshop, and then they added to ChatGPT.
@@@
For some reason, they then added Photoshop to ChatGPT.
@@@
Well, and also Acrobat.
@@@
For those who don't know, it's a piece of software for editing PDFs.
@@@
And Adobe Express.
@@@
I honestly don't even know what Express is.
@@@
It's for layout design.
@@@
Like a quick tool.
@@@
So, in short, now you can...
@@@
Well, honestly, I looked at the pictures, I didn't understand how it works.
@@@
Some kind of lightweight version opens up, like...
@@@
It works, I'll tell you how.
@@@
And I haven't had a chance to test it properly yet, but I've set it up...
@@@
It's a connector, it's an application.
@@@
So for it to work, you need to go into settings, and right there,
@@@
I think, for...
@@@
Acrobat and Express, I could be wrong, you have to log in to your Adobe account.
@@@
It doesn't have to be a paid one, but you do have to log in.
@@@
And with Photoshop, I think, you just click add, and bo...
@@@
one of them works without a login.
@@@
But overall, it's a direct integration with these services.
@@@
And Adobe had a big article about it.
@@@
And it works through some kind of layer they have.
@@@
It works through some API SDK there.
@@@
So basically, you include either Adobe Acrobat or Photoshop in the dialogue and say, here's a PSD file, please change the layers,
@@@
delete one, add a second, a third, and in the output you get the same edited PSD file with new layers.
@@@
What caused a storm of emotions on the internet was that you can now create and edit PDFs via ChatGPT.
@@@
I just made this prompt right now, wrote, make me a PDF with the text Alexey, and the Adobe Acrobat app literally tells me, Create PDF, yes, Create PDF, and it creates a PDF for me, and it says "Hello, Alexey" there.
@@@
And the Acrobat interface opens up, where you can edit the resulting file yourself.
@@@
Oh, by the way, it did ask for a login.
@@@
So it's a super tight integration with these products.
@@@
And people went crazy over Acrobat, because they're saying, how is this possible, Adobe never sold this technology to anyone, they always charged money for it, and now ChatGPT 5...
@@@
Yeah, yeah.
@@@
There you go.
@@@
In short, this is probably the most,
@@@
well, not to say complex, but the most thorough integration from OpenAI in the last six months.
@@@
A powerful integration.
@@@
That's regarding ChatGPT. Overall, ChatGPT is flourishing thanks to integrations.
@@@
If we go back to programming, because they had a pretty big update with Codex CLI.
@@@
Let's go back there for a bit too.
@@@
Codex CLI is their development agent.
@@@
And it got an integration with the Linear tracking system, the ability to create custom slash commands, and they brought in GPT 5.2 Codex, as mentioned above.
