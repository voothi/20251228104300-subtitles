So what's new with you?
@@@
What's new with me?
@@@
I was in Poland.
@@@
Seriously?
@@@
Recently, yeah.
@@@
Who did you meet with?
@@@
With you.
@@@
No way?
@@@
Yeah.
@@@
So what were we doing there?
@@@
Oh, we were preparing a New Year's surprise for our subscribers.
@@@
Oh yeah, at the end today we'll talk a little more about it, right?
@@@
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
@@@
Yeah.
@@@
I see.
@@@
So I was in Warsaw too, it turns out.
@@@
Met you.
@@@
I was also in Krakow and saw Krakow for the first time in my life.
@@@
Was it your first time in Krakow?
@@@
Yeah, yeah.
@@@
And how did you like it?
@@@
Beautiful.
@@@
Listen, well, all that's left for you is to get to Wroclaw.
@@@
Yeah, and you can say you've seen all of Poland.
@@@
Pretty much all of Poland.
@@@
Could I have just gone to Wroclaw?
@@@
Well, yeah.
@@@
What are you talking about?
@@@
Well, look, I've been to Warsaw, I've been to Gdansk.
@@@
And Krakow now.
@@@
So only Wroclaw is left, it turns out.
@@@
Wait.
@@@
Lublin.
@@@
Poznan.
@@@
Bialystok.
@@@
Lodz.
@@@
Bialystok.
@@@
Katowice.
@@@
That's just what I...
@@@
Biala Podlaska, but that's...
@@@
Biala Podlaska.
@@@
Bielsko-Biala.
@@@
Zakopane.
@@@
Zielona Gora.
@@@
Jelenia Gora.
@@@
Bydgoszcz.
@@@
A ton of cities that are worth visiting.
@@@
What's most interesting is that in Poland they are more or less similar, but still, each one has something of its own.
@@@
Every single one stands out in some way.
@@@
You still need to travel around Poland more.
@@@
I'm telling you.
@@@
Anyway, yeah, yeah.
@@@
Get me a Globe of Poland, please, so I know where to go.
@@@
Better yet, someday I'll gift you a vacation in Poland.
@@@
There.
@@@
We'll get in a car and drive all over Poland.
@@@
That would be awesome.
@@@
That would be awesome.
@@@
We could record an episode from the car at the same time.
@@@
Yeah, by the way, yeah.
@@@
If you want to become sponsors for our episode from the car, we've already been in contact.
@@@
Write to us.
@@@
Hello everyone, our dear podcast listeners.
@@@
This is a new episode of the Na Vibe podcast.
@@@
A podcast about news, artificial intelligence, and all sorts of other topics related to artificial intelligence for programmers and beyond.
@@@
And with you are your regular hosts - myself, Viktor Shlenchenko, and...
@@@
I'm Alexey Kartynnik.
@@@
Yeeeah, super.
@@@
Okay, what was that?
@@@
For the second time in the history of our podcast.
@@@
You swiped, I'm not afraid to use the word, my intro.
@@@
Well, you were silent, so I took the intro into my own hands.
@@@
Well, alright, thank you actually, because today my mood is kinda meh.
@@@
For all Belarusians, I would say.
@@@
Those who know, know.
@@@
That's for sure, that's for sure.
@@@
So,
@@@
we've done the intro.
@@@
Done.
@@@
Yeah, done.
@@@
We're not playing music today.
@@@
But we are playing something else.
@@@
We're putting up a reminder for our dear listeners that the Na Vibe podcast, formerly the AIA podcast, is now released exclusively thanks to our premium listeners.
@@@
Premium listeners are people who give us a recurring donation.
@@@
We have several different subscription plans: Go, Pro, and Ultra, where, besides supporting us, which is kind of the main point of these donations, you also get a lot of different cool bonuses.
@@@
For example, you get added to the premium chat, you get access to recordings of all our streams uncensored and without any cuts whatsoever.
@@@
And we post them earlier, literally right away.
@@@
Like, we record today, and we post it tonight.
@@@
No need to wait.
@@@
They appear there earlier, so there's no need to wait.
@@@
You also get access to a unique post-cast, the Post-Vibe Post-cast.
@@@
It's a completely separate podcast that exists exclusively for our premium listeners, where Lesha and I talk about all sorts of interesting things related to AI, science fiction, and other stuff.
@@@
For example, we have an episode where Lesha talks about a science fiction book by a Belarusian author called "Pentakvandr".
@@@
Actually, it's a pretty unique episode, because the book isn't very popular yet.
@@@
And maybe you'll be able to read it, or maybe you'll be able to listen to it.
@@@
Well, there's some inside info that it's slowly being translated into English from Belarusian, but you can still treat yourself.
@@@
Nevertheless, yes, you can treat yourself.
@@@
We have a True Crime podcast, which, damn, I wrote myself with Chat GPT.
@@@
A debut?
@@@
The debut one, yes, about AI murders, so to speak.
@@@
And a third one, the very newest, the latest one, hot off the press, where I retell Andy Weir's book Project Hail Mary.
@@@
And what's more, you can manage to listen to it before the film adaptation comes out.
@@@
It's coming out in 2026.
@@@
If you happen to be afraid of spoilers, don't be.
@@@
It's heavy-duty science fiction that's impossible to retell in any detail in an hour and a half.
@@@
So there are plot spoilers, but they're the big-picture ones.
@@@
And overall, personally, I haven't read the book, and I'm planning to watch the movie.
@@@
And after that summary, I have even more of a pre-New Year's desire to read the book, because the plot is interesting and I want to get into the details.
@@@
Yeah, that's true.
@@@
And I retold the details very shittily.
@@@
Intentionally.
@@@
Yes, purely intentionally.
@@@
Not because I'm dumb and don't understand half of the physics references written there.
@@@
But just intentionally.
@@@
That's right.
@@@
Yes, all these episodes are already available.
@@@
So subscribe, subscribe, you'll have a great time.
@@@
Especially at this time, before the New Year, when there's a lot of time to listen to something good.
@@@
And there will only be more episodes, actually.
@@@
And for other bonuses, that's not all the bonuses available to our premium members.
@@@
All premium members get access to a premium chat, where we answer first, we hang out there, we chat.
@@@
Also, all premium members get access to the SMS chat.
@@@
It's a little chat where you can send your messages of up to 120 characters before each episode.
@@@
Like in text messages.
@@@
And we will read these messages live on air.
@@@
By the way, we have one text message today.
@@@
We'll read it shortly.
@@@
And if you subscribe to the maximum Ultra tier, along with it you'll get a yearly subscription to the Code Evolution club, where you can seriously level up in programming with AI.
@@@
And you'll get a yearly subscription to the DeeDee app, where you can keep your ADHD in check.
@@@
Very well.
@@@
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
@@@
A full year's access.
@@@
That's all correct.
@@@
So there are a lot of bonuses, the bonuses are cool, but first and foremost, you'll be supporting our podcast this way.
@@@
Right now it's really released exclusively thanks to you, thanks to our audience, thanks to your support for this podcast.
@@@
Yeah, and guys, I get that, like, maybe some of you are tired of hearing us, guys and girls, talk about this, and today with pretty sour faces on top of it, but this is truly fucking important.
@@@
I mean, well, we get donations, but it's honestly not nearly enough yet.
@@@
And if you've been thinking about whether to donate or not, please, think again, find the opportunity if you have one.
@@@
Thank you.
@@@
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
@@@
We need at least, I think, 200-300 donors so we can more or less breathe a sigh of relief.
@@@
Right now we have what, 37 people?
@@@
Around 36.
@@@
Just keeping you in the loop, yeah.
@@@
So the number isn't tiny, but it's not large either.
@@@
We're counting on your support.
@@@
We seem to be doing good things.
@@@
And if you want to hear the quality of the extra content we release, these three extra episodes, we show them to you, we usually tease them in the episodes.
@@@
Today at the end of our podcast there will be 6 minutes from the episode where Vitya talks about the Project Hail Mary.
@@@
You can listen to it too, and judge for yourself.
@@@
Maybe it will be easier for you to make a decision after that.
@@@
And, I guess, it's worth saying that we're also looking for partners.
@@@
If someone listening to us suddenly wants to help the podcast by becoming a permanent sponsor of the podcast,
@@@
contact us directly.
@@@
All contact information is in the podcast description.
@@@
It could be a one-time donation from a person or a company.
@@@
It could be full sponsorship support, where we'll talk about your services, your things, and make a separate segment for you.
@@@
You'll be supporting us that way.
@@@
We will gladly accept all of that.
@@@
So, reach out.
@@@
In short, we do ads too.
@@@
Just like everyone else.
@@@
Well, on that note, I think we can begin.
@@@
Yes, let's move on to our regular segment "Big Fish".
@@@
By the way, this is the last "Big Fish" of the year.
@@@
Just so you know.
@@@
Because the next episode will be unusual.
@@@
There will be no big fish there.
@@@
That's a small spoiler for it.
@@@
So that's why "Big Fish".
@@@
And they start with, what would you think.
@@@
No suspense, with OpenAI.
@@@
This is going to be the saddest episode of all time for us.
@@@
Yeah, it's fucked.
@@@
Vitya says, the last "Big Fish" and I'm like...
@@@
Fuck...
@@@
Yeah, I said it, and then I realized.
@@@
Alright, let's start with OpenAI.
@@@
OpenAI.
@@@
Anyway, anyway.
@@@
As we know, there's a national sport in the US.
@@@
And not just in the US.
@@@
It's investing in OpenAI.
@@@
And now Amazon will be investing in OpenAI.
@@@
Just so you know, the deal is for 500 billion bucks.
@@@
What 500 billion?
@@@
10.
@@@
500 is the valuation OpenAI will secure after this deal.
@@@
Damn, yeah, sorry.
@@@
Amazon doesn't have that much money.
@@@
They're worth 4 billion there.
@@@
4 trillion or however much.
@@@
Yes, I'm sorry, please excuse me.
@@@
Yeah, Bezos wouldn't have forked over that much.
@@@
Anyway, 10 billion bucks.
@@@
The total valuation of OpenAI becomes 500 billion.
@@@
And, as a matter of fact, the supply of Titanium chips to OpenAI.
@@@
Trainium.
@@@
Well, basically, they will provide that 10 billion just with these Trainium chips.
